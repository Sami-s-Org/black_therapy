                <h3>Why Therapy for Black Men Matters</h3>
                <p>
                  My greatest joy in life was being a stay-at-home dad. That role, rooted in love and service, taught me
                  the profound importance of presence, connection, and intentional impact. It shaped my understanding of
                  what it truly means to nurture potential and inspired me to extend that care beyond my own family
                </p>
                <p>
                  My father instilled in my brothers and me a passion for sports—a foundation that introduced me to
                  discipline, resilience, and teamwork. Whether it was basketball, football, baseball, or track, these
                  experiences fueled my growth and became a cornerstone of my identity. Coaching naturally followed,
                  allowing me to guide others toward their best selves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through fatherhood and coaching, I witnessed firsthand the transformative power of genuine support in
                  shaping mental and emotional well-being. This realization became my calling: to create a space where
                  Black men could find the care and guidance they need to thrive. Together with my wife, Vladimire, we
                  built TherapyForBlackMen.org—a platform to educate, inspire, and empower Black men every single day.
                </p>
                <h3>Championing Mental Wellness for Black Men</h3>
                <p>
                  As a certified professional coach and New York University-trained life and executive coach, I approach
                  health and wellness holistically. My professional journey includes 17 years in customer relations and
                  8 years in managerial roles, blending hands-on experience with a deep commitment to advocacy and
                  empowerment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology from Brooklyn College, I have spent my career
                  equipping individuals with the tools to achieve personal and professional growth. Through Therapy for
                  Black Men, I am driven to eliminate barriers that prevent Black men from accessing mental health
                  resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our directory provides free therapy sessions with qualified professionals and connects men to
                  culturally resonant support. By bridging the gap between need and access, we strive to ensure that
                  Black men and boys have the resources they deserve.
                </p>
                <h3>A Voice for Change</h3>
                <p>
                  In addition to our direct services, I am deeply committed to raising awareness of the systemic issues
                  affecting Black men. From unconscious bias and inclusion to the empathy gap and societal perceptions,
                  I speak at organizations such as Walmart and the Congressional Black Caucus to address these
                  challenges and foster change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also serve as a Couples Coach, focusing on holistic approaches to relationships and guiding
                  individuals toward deeper connections.
                </p>
                <h3>A Life Rooted in Love and Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                  When I’m not coaching or advocating, you’ll often find me reading, writing, or coaching my children in
                  track and field. I’m proud to have been married to my incredible wife, Vladimire, for 20 years, and
                  together we’ve built a family centered on love and growth.
                </p>
                <h3>Why This Work Matters</h3>
                <p>
                  Our mission is simple but vital: to improve the mental health and overall well-being of Black men and
                  boys, breaking the cycles of unaddressed wounds and generational pain. We are here to say that Black
                  men deserve better—because healing isn’t just an option, it’s a right.

                <p>
                  As a child growing up without a father in the household, I felt the weight of an immeasurable void.
                  Watching other children interact with their fathers was a painful reminder of the connection I yearned
                  for but never had. That early loss shaped me profoundly, instilling a deep understanding of how
                  unhealed wounds can affect every aspect of our lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through my own personal struggles and two decades as a therapist, I’ve come to see a universal truth:
                  we’ve all carried the scars of trauma in some form. Yet, for Black men, the weight of societal
                  expectations often multiplies that pain. From the time they are boys, Black men are told to “be
                  strong,” “walk it off,” “don’t cry,” and “man up.” These harmful messages discourage vulnerability and
                  perpetuate silent suffering.
                </p>
                <p>I’m here to tell you: you’re not meant to go on your journey alone.</p>

                <h3>Why I Founded TherapyForBlackMen.org</h3>
                <p>
                  As a mother and wife, I witness the immeasurable power of a loving father and husband in shaping a
                  family. I see my husband, Benjamin, pouring his strength and care into our children every single day.
                  His presence shows me just how transformational healing and love can be.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a therapist, I have the privilege of witnessing the courage Black men bring into the therapy space.
                  Each story they share is an act of bravery, a defiance of the harmful stereotypes that seek to silence
                  them. I started TherapyForBlackMen.org to create a sanctuary—a place where men of color could access
                  the tools, support, and community needed to reclaim their strength and rewrite their narratives.
                </p>

                  truth—that strength is found in vulnerability, and healing is your birthright.

                  Sabrina’s work is more than just photography—it’s a reflection of her passion for human connection and
                  storytelling. Her artistry bridges cultures, celebrates diversity, and amplifies voices that often go
                  unheard. Whether she’s behind the scenes of a high-profile event or on a mission to document everyday
                  resilience, Sabrina brings authenticity, care, and a profound respect for her craft and her subjects.

                  Through her photography, Sabrina continues to redefine what it means to see, to understand, and to
                  connect. As the Celebrity Photographer for Therapy for Black Men, she captures the essence of the
                  movement—men standing in their truth, breaking barriers, and embracing healing.
