                <p>
                  Georges Louis-Jeune is a devoted leader, compassionate advocate, and a champion of creating meaningful
                  impact for individuals and families. As the Information Systems Manager for CVS Corporation, Georges
                  balances his professional expertise with a deeply personal mission: to empower others to live with
                  purpose, joy, and resilience
                </p>{' '}
                <p>
                  A native of Brooklyn, NY, Georges carries the values of community, accountability, and leadership into
                  every aspect of his life. With a bachelor’s degree in Business and a focus on leadership from

                For over 23 years, Georges has shared his life with his wife, building a family rooted in love and
                support in their Massachusetts home with their two children. His belief in the power of a strong support
                system fuels his passion for giving back. He thrives on being involved in processes that not only
                transform lives but also strengthen families and communities
              </p>
              <p>
                Georges holds fast to the idea that having the right tools—whether for a project, a personal challenge,
                or a dream—makes success possible. Yet he also recognizes the power of human connection, believing that
                sometimes all it takes to change a life is a listening ear.

              <h3>Why Therapy for Black Men Matters</h3>
              <p>
                For Georges, Therapy for Black Men represents more than a platform—it’s a movement to dismantle
                barriers, foster healing, and empower Black men to reclaim their mental health and well-being. He
                understands that accountability, leadership, and support are key ingredients in personal transformation,
                and he is committed to helping the organization expand its reach and impact.
              </p>
              <p>
                "When we empower Black men to heal and lead, we transform families, communities, and the future. It all
                begins with connection and the courage to listen."
